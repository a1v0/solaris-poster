# Solaris Movie Poster

This was an idea that came from [MattScarthSaunders](https://github.com/MattScarthSaunders) ([this is his version](https://github.com/MattScarthSaunders/code-challenges/tree/main/solaris)).

It looked like a laugh so I wanted to try the same. The concept is to recreate a film poster using only vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

To see the result, clone the repo and open `poster.html` in any browser.

## To-dos

1. create source files
2. create colour scheme
3. plan basic structure of page
4. ensure basic page renders well on any screen size
   1. this means creating a container within the page whose proportions won't change
